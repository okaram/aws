AWS SQS allows programs to send messages to a queue, and other programs to read those messages and act on them; the programs can communicate, but are only loosely coupled, and may not even be running at the same time.

== creating the Queue

A simples cloudformation template would be as follows: 

[source,YAML]
.Simples SQS queue
----
include::{sourcedir}/SimpleQueue.yml[]
----

== Sending messages
[source,Groovy]
.Sending.groovy
----
include::{sourcedir}/enqueue.groovy[]
----

== Receiving messages
[source,groovy]
.dequeue.groovy
----
include::{sourcedir}/dequeue.groovy[]
