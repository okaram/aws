= Developing with AWS

I am (constantly) learning AWS, and want to document (at least for myself, hopefully it will be useful to others) what I learn.

I am using https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/[CloudFormation] for creating all my resources, and Python or http://www.groovy-lang.org/[Groovy] as my implementation language
