AWS S3 allows us to store and retrieve files in the cloud; we have cheap and virtually unlimited space.

S3 stores files in *buckets*, which have a globally-unique name; we can create a bucket using cloudformation; 

== creating the bucket

the simplest cloudformation template would be as follows (replace the bucket name)

[source,YAML]
.Simplest yml bucket
----
include::{sourcedir}/SimplestBucket.yml[]
----

== Downloading a file
[source,Groovy]
.download.groovy
----
include::{sourcedir}/download.groovy[]
----

== Uploading a file
[source,groovy]
.download.groovy
----
include::{sourcedir}/upload.groovy[]
----
